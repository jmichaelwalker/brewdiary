      <p>I’ve been making my own beer for the past year or two. I’ve been lucky though. We have a large group of friends to help us drink it all. It’s allowed me to brew a batch every month or so to get my technique down, so to speak. I’ve actually gotten pretty good at it. The quick turnaround time has allowed me to practice, experiment and practice some more.<hr />

    <h2>Where does beer get its flavor?</h2>
    <p>You've no doubt heard or seen beer described with various flavors and tastes -- malty, chocolate, citrus, etc.  Perhaps you've wondered how those flavors come about.  It all has to do with the ingredients.<br />
       <br />
      Beer is usually made from four basic ingredients: water, malt, hops and yeast.  Water accounts for more than 90% of the beer. In the past, a water's mineral content greatly influenced the flavor of the beer, but, today, water can be chemically adjusted to create the exact style of beer desired. <br />
       <br />
      Malt is what's left of the grain once it's been allowed to barely germinate and then slightly heated to stop the growth process but not stop the activity of the diastase, a natural enzyme which converts starch into maltose, or sugar.  This sugar is what the yeast metabolizes into carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol.  Sometimes a portion of the malt is heated to a higher temperature to roast it.  While this malted grain no longer has active diastase, it will add flavor to the beer.  Usually, the more roasted the malt is the greater color and flavor it will impart.  This is where a beer gets caramel, chocolate and/or coffee flavors.  Other flavors depend on the grain used: barley, rice, corn, oats, wheat or a combination.<br />
       <br />
      Hops are a flowering vine.  The flowers are usually dried and used as a preservative and for their essential oils.  When the oils add flavor, the hops are referred to as bittering hops.  They're called aroma hops when they're used for their aroma.  Both types of hops are used to balance the sweetness of the malt.<br />
       <br />
      Then we have the yeast, a fungus that feeds on the sugars, turning them into alcohol.  Different strains of yeast will each impart their own flavor, although the malt and hops are the main flavor components. If the yeast adds little flavor, then the beer is usually described as having a &quot;clean taste.&quot; Yeast produce three metabolic by-products that affect beer taste: phenols -- a spicy, clove-like or medicinal taste; esters -- a fruity taste; Diacetyls -- a butterscotch or &quot;woody&quot; taste. The presence of any of these flavor components depends largely on the style of beer being brewed, as well as on an individual's palate and the effect the brewer desires.  <br />
       <br />
      <a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/ale">Ale</a> yeast ferment at the &quot;top&quot; of the fermentation vessel at a higher temperature, and they work quicker.  The average fermentation time for ale yeast is 7-8 days.  By-products of ale yeast, esters, deliver the &quot;flowery&quot; aromas of apple, pear, pineapple, grass, hay, plum and prune. <br />
       <br />
      <a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/lager">Lager</a>, German for store, is a yeast that ferments at the bottom of the vessel and at much lower temperatures.  This colder fermentation process takes longer, and lager yeast produce fewer aromatics than ale yeast due to the lack of esters.  Lagers tend to have more aroma from the hops, which complements the sweet malt flavor.<br />
       <br />
      Finally, some beer styles are &quot;spiced,&quot; which means they've had ingredients such as coriander, curacao or all-spice added, while others are flavored with different fruits. <br />
       <br />
      Regardless of the flavor, something you may have noticed is that most beers can be broken down into one of two types, ale or lager.  So now you not only know where beer gets its flavor but also how its style is determined.<br />
