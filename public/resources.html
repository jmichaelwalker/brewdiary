      <p>I’ve been making my own beer for the past year or two. I’ve been lucky though. We have a large group of friends to help us drink it all. It’s allowed me to brew a batch every month or so to get my technique down, so to speak. I’ve actually gotten pretty good at it. The quick turnaround time has allowed me to practice, experiment and practice some more.<hr />

    <h2>Want to learn how to brew your own?</h2>
    <p>I’ve been making my own beer for the past year or two. I’ve been lucky though. We have a large group of friends to help us drink it all. It’s allowed me to brew up a batch every month to get my chops up, so to speak. Now I’ve actually gotten pretty good at brewing. The quick turnaround time has allowed me to practice, practice and experiment. </p>
    <p>It wasn’t always this way. I’ve tried making beer in the past - a few times in high school and college - and each time it was a complete and utter failure. It wasn’t that I couldn’t make beer. I made beer. Making beer is actually the easy part. However, the beer I made was just completely undrinkable. Thankfully, that’s all changed.</p>
    <p>Don’t get me wrong. Making good beer isn’t all that difficult, it just takes a bit of technique.</p>
    <h3>Here are a few sites to get you started...</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com" title="home brew talk" target="new">Home Brew Talk</a><br />
    Without a doubt - this is my favorite site that is dedicated to the fine art of homebrewing. Most of the recipes that I currently follow and change are from this site. </p>
    <p><a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/" target="new">American Homebrewers Association</a><br />
      The American Homebrewers Association is a huge website, and includes tons of info about brewing beer and about beer in general. To access some homebrewing information, click on “let’s brew”</p>
    <p>Here you will find lots of useful articles and videos about homebrewing, along with useful links and recommended readings. You can choose what to read according to your level, so if you’ve never brewed before, start with “Get Started”.</p>
    <p>Be sure to also check out the <a href="http://wiki.homebrewersassociation.org/">Homebrewopedia</a>, which includes extensive lists of ingredients, recipes, brewing terms, equipment and more.</p>
    <p>This wiki is worth a bookmark, as many other websites don’t include all this information, and it’s nice to have a source to fall back to when there’s a word you don’t understand or an ingredient you don’t recognize.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.beersmith.com/blog/">BeerSmith</a><br />
      BeerSmith is actually a beer-making software, but its blog includes a lot of useful information in the form of articles, recipes, a podcast, a brewing wiki and more.</p>
    <p>The folks at BeerSmith arranged all their best articles into a book, which you can read, chapter by chapter, for free. If you’re more into audio, there’s a podcast with almost 30 episodes you can listen to on the website. There’s also a huge <a href="http://www.beersmith.com/beer-recipes/">recipe index</a>, containing almost 400 recipes, with each recipe including almost any piece of information you ever wanted to know about this beer.</p>
    <p>If you’re doing this seriously, you can also get a free trial of the BeerSmith <a href="http://www.beersmith.com/features/">brewing software.</a></p>
    <p><a href="http://drinkcraftbeer.com/home-brewing/">Drink Craft Beer</a><br />
      Drink Craft Beer is a general beer website, which also includes a homebrewing section.  Here you will find a step by step guide, including photos, on how to brew your own beer at home. The guide doesn’t seem to include a recipe, and it also doesn’t really explain terms, so it might be more suitable if you’ve already read some on the subject. You could also use another source to clarify terms and get exact recipes.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.homebrewing.com/">Homebrewing.com</a><br />
    This website is actually a store for homebrewing supplies (which could come in handy too), but it also includes an article section, quite a few brewing calculators, and some useful references.</p>
    <p>You can browse the articles by subject, so this is a good place to go if you’re looking to read up on a specific topic, such as fermentation or kegging. The references are great too, and include some useful charts and lists.</p>
    <p><a href="http://makebeerathome.info/">Make Beer At Home</a><br />
      Making Beer At Home, as the name implies, tries to help you with making beer at home. While the actual content is useful, the website itself is a bit hard to navigate. If you put your heart to it, though, you can find lots of great content, such as step by step brewing guides, online calculators, a recipe index and more.</p>
    <p>If you’re confused, you can make use of the <a href="http://makebeerathome.info/site-map">site map</a> to find your way around.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.basicbrewing.com/">Basic Brewing</a><br />
      Basic Brewing offers its own podcast and video series, all about brewing your own beer. The podcasts and videos date back to 2005, and include lots of various beer-related topics. Unfortunately, you can’t search through them, so the only way to find something you’re looking for is by browsing the archive.<br />
      If you’re in the US, check out the “Where To Buy” section, for a list of brewing-supplies vendors in different states.<br />
       <br />
      <a href="http://brewbeeranddrinkit.com/">Brew Beer And Drink It</a><br />
    Brew Beer and Drink It is all about helping you learn how to homebrew. The only problem is that it’s not so easy to find that help. While it does include some very interesting content, the website is somewhat confusing to browse, and finding what you’re looking for can be a bit of a challenge. Having said that, it does include a nice collection of How-to videos about different types of beers, which you can access from this menu if you scroll down some.</p>
    <p>It also contains a collection of articles you may find useful. There is no easy way to access them that I could find, except using the archive at the bottom. It’s worth exploring, though, as there are some interesting articles to be found.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.homebrewingvideo.com/">Homebrewing Video</a><br />
      This is a collection of beer brewing videos, ranging from ones aimed at the very beginners, all the way to “racking to a secondary fermenter”. You can view all the videos, or screen them according to categories.</p>
    <p>If you’re into wine making, there are some videos about that here too.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Beer/">How To Make Beer Instructable</a><br />
      If you’re into instructables, there are several of those that show you, step by step, how to make beer at home. This How to Make Beer instructable leads you slowly through the process in a way that’s not too overwhelming. The photos seem to have been taken in a regular home, just like ours, and it includes a detailed list of equipment and an exact recipe.</p>
    <p>There are more of these beer-making guides on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a>, so if this one is not cutting it for you, make sure to check out the suggestions on the right side of the page.</p>
